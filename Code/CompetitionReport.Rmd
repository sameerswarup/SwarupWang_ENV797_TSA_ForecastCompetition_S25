# Data Wrangling

Transform the hourly data into daily data:

Cleaned Dataframes: daily_load, daily temp, daily_humidity

```{r}
# Load the demand excel file
load_df <- read_excel("./Data/load.xlsx")
  
daily_load <- load_df %>% 
  group_by(meter_id, date) %>%
  summarize(
    daily_avg = mean(c_across(1:24), na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups   = "drop"
  )

# Load the temperature file
temp_df <- read_excel("./Data/temperature.xlsx")

daily_temp <- temp_df[1:3] %>% 
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(
    daily_avg = mean(t_ws1, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups   = "drop"
  )

# Load the humidity file
humidity_df <- read_excel("./Data/relative_humidity.xlsx")

daily_humidity <- humidity_df[1:3] %>% 
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(
    daily_avg = mean(rh_ws1, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups   = "drop"
  )
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
