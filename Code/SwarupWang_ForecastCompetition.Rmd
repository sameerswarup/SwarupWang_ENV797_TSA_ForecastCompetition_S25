## Data Wrangling

Transform the hourly data into daily data
```{r}
load_df <- read_excel("./Data/load.xlsx")
  
daily_load <- load_df %>% 
  group_by(meter_id, date) %>%
  summarize(
    daily_avg = mean(c_across(1:24), na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups   = "drop"
  )
```

## Create a Time Series Object

After processing your dataset, use the msts() function to create a time series object. You need to use msts() instead of ts() because your daily data has more than one seasonal component.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
